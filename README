Description: The program implements UDP based communication with reliability and data encryption/decryption.
             Reliability: Stop and Wait ARQ protocol has been implemented in this program to obtain reliable file transfer between client and the server (local & remote)
			              The sender while waiting for an ack waits for 100ms for data to be received at socket:
						  If wrong ack received : wait for another 10 ms before deciding if to send next packet or same packet 
						  If timeout: Send the same packet again
						  If expected ack received: Send the next packet
						  Note: Ack is sent by receiver for every packet received 
						  The receiver if does not get any data for 800 ms from sender then it is timed out. Accepts new command
						  Number of packets have been compared to check for successful transmission of the file
						 
			Encryption/
			Decryption : Bitwise XOR operation is performed on each character of the string in the data packet with character 'S' for encryption and decryption
			             
Run the Client with the following command: make
                                          ./udp_client.o <ip address of the server> <port_number>
										  
Example: ./udp_client_packet.o 128.138.201.67 5665
		  
Run the Server with the following command: make 
                                           ./udp_server.o <port_number>
Example: ./udp_server_packet.o 5665
						 
User Menu:

“get [file_name]”       : The server transmits the requested file to the client (use files of small size in order of 5 KB for transfer like any jpeg file).
“put [file_name]”       : The server receives the transmitted file by the client and stores it locally (use files of small size in order of 5 KB for transfer like any jpeg file).
“delete [file_name]”    : The server delete file if it exists. Otherwise do nothing.
“ls”                    : The server searches all the files it has in its local directory and send a list of all these files to the client.
“exit”                  : The server should exit gracefully.
Any other commands      : The server should simply repeat the command back to the client with no modification, stating that the given command was not understood.

Note: Ctrl+C is used to exit the server

Observation: Verifies for file transfer over 100 MB from local to remote. Obtains same MD5sum on both sides.
